wrap provider = store main.tsx

make counterSlice.ts at redux ---> feature ---> counter

make a slice

return counterSlice.reducer

counterSlice e business logic write korechi

now make a action where we export and work this

we make dispatch at app.tsx

make a useSelector into app.tsx

now we can easily destructure and use it

differnece export const app export default app
